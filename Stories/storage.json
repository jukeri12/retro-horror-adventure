What greets you upon entry is a rather sordid sight; empty bottles upon empty bottles of alcohol, a violent smell of vomit and sweat\nand general dirtiness; telltale marks of heavy alcoholism. You don't think there's much to be found here at first: Then you notice one of the bottles giving off a blue flame.\nThe alcohol is burning; that's possibly dangerous and also rather weird. You could try to put it out, or you could always tell other people that you noticed the door being open, got worried and noticed the burning alcohol.",
